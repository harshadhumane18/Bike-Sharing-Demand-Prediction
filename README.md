## Project Overview
Rental bikes have been introduced in many urban cities to enhance mobility comfort. It is crucial to make the rental bikes available and accessible to the public at the right time to lessen the waiting time. The critical part of this project is the prediction of the bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

## Objective
The project aims to enhance urban mobility by optimizing the supply of rental bikes. By predicting the hourly demand for bikes, we aim to ensure their availability and accessibility, thereby reducing waiting times and improving user comfort.

## Machine Learning Project Approach
The general approach for this machine learning project will be as follows:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from various sources and combine them into a single, coherent dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the distribution and correlation of variables, identify patterns and trends in the data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features from existing ones to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.
5. **Model Building**: Build a predictive model to estimate the hourly demand for bikes.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics and visualization techniques.

## Conclusion
Weather significantly influences bike sharing demand, with summer (37.0% rentals) thriving due to warmth and longer days, while winter lags (7.9%) due to cold and shorter daylight. Non-holidays spark high rentals (nearing 6 million) driven by commuting and recreation, contrasting reduced demand during holidays. Rentals peak in July (over 700,000) and dip in January (slightly above 300,000), aligning with weather conditions. Commute hours (6-8 AM, 5-6 PM) and evenings (7 PM) mark peak rentals, reflecting work/school travel and recreational biking. Positive correlations of temperature (0.54) and hour (0.41) indicate higher rentals in hotter weather and specific times. Conversely, humidity (-0.2) and rainfall (-0.12) negatively impact rentals. Factors like Wind Speed, Visibility, Dew Point Temperature, etc., hold relevance but wield weaker impacts on rentals. The XGBoost regressor outperforms with significantly lower error metrics (MSE and RMSE) on training and testing data. It's the optimal model for precise bike sharing demand prediction, aiding in strategic business decisions.
